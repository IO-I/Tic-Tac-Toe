# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple command-line based implementation of the popular game "Tic Tac Toe". The game board is represented by a 3x3 matrix, with empty cells represented by a blank space (" "). The two players are represented by "X" and "O", respectively.

## Game Rules
Each player takes turns placing their symbol on the board. The objective is to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game ends when either one of the players achieves this objective or the board is completely filled without any player winning.

## How to Play
The board is labeled with a coordinate system, consisting of the columns A, B, C and the rows 1, 2, 3. The user is prompted to enter the coordinates of the cell they wish to place their symbol on, using the following format: "row column". For example, to place the symbol "X" in the top-left corner of the board, the user would enter "1A".

In addition to regular gameplay, the user can enter the following commands:

"help" - Displays a help message with a list of commands.

"restart" - Resets the game board and starts a new game.

"quit" - Ends the current game and exits the program.

.. and another funtion ;-)

## Files
This repository contains a single Python file, main.py, which contains the implementation of the game.

## Usage
To play the game, simply run the main.py file using Python. The game will start immediately and the user will be prompted to enter their first move.
