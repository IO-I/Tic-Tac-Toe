# Tic-Tac-Toe

programmed in python3. 

How to play:
First the game asks if you want to play with names (options yes, no). Depending on how you choose, the congratulations for the winner will be different. Type help to see the manual for other commands such as quit and restart. 
To insert your Symbol in the gamefield, enter a valid combination (e.g. a3, 2a, C1). The order of Number and Character does not matter. If the provided location is out of range or is alredy filled, the game will tell you right in the command line.

Have fun playing!
